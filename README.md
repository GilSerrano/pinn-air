In this work, we explore the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to model the dynamics of multirotor slung load systems. We propose a novel a combination of neural network architecture + training strategy that is able to learn the dynamics of the system from a limited number of data points. We also propose a novel dataset for multirotor slung load systems, which is used to train and evaluate the proposed model.

<b>Code and dataset will be released upon publication of the associated paper.</b>
